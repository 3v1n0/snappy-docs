This section provides you with details about the content and structure of a snap. There is sufficient information in this section to enable you to create your own snap files manually. That said, this information is primarily meant as background to help with your understanding of how Snapcraft builds snaps.

This section contains details of:

- [the folder structure of content in a snap](/docs/architecture/snaps).
- [the content of the snap's metadata YAML file](/docs/architecture/metadata).
