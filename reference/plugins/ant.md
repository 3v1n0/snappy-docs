The ant plugin is useful for ant based parts.

The ant build system is commonly used to build Java projects.
The plugin requires a build.xml in the root of the source tree.

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for "sources".
For more information check the 'plugins' topic for the former and the
'sources' topic for the latter.
