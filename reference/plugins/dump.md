title: "The dump plugin"
---

This plugin just dumps the content from a specified source.

This plugin uses the common plugin keywords as well as those for 'sources'.
For more information check the 'plugins' topic for the former and the
'sources' topic for the latter.

In the cases where dumping the content needs some mangling or organizing
one would take advantage of the core functionalities available to plugins
such as: `filesets`, `stage`, `snap` and `organize`.
