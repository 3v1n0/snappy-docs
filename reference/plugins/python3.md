title: "The python3 plugin"
---

The python3 plugin can be used for python 3 based parts.

The python3 plugin can be used for python 3 projects where you would
want to do:

    - import python modules with a requirements.txt
    - build a python project that has a setup.py
    - install sources straight from pip

This plugin uses the following plugin-specific keywords:

    - requirements:
      (string)
      path to a requirements.txt file
    - python-packages:
      (list)
      A list of dependencies to get from PyPi
